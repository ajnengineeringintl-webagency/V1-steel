# V1 Steel — Static Website (HTML/CSS/JS)

This is a simple static website scaffold for a steel business (V1 Steel). It includes:

- `index.html` — main page with hero, services, projects, about, and contact sections.
- `styles.css` — responsive styling and layout.
- `script.js` — mobile nav, smooth scrolling, and contact form validation + simulated submission.

How to use:
1. Copy the files into your project folder (e.g., `ajnengineeringintl-webagency/V1-steel`).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site.
3. Replace placeholder images with your own assets and update content as needed.
4. To enable real contact submissions, integrate the form with a backend endpoint or third-party form service and update the JS accordingly.

Notes:
- Images are placeholders (via.placeholder.com). Replace them with real photos or SVGs.
- Accessible and semantic markup is used; tweak as needed for branding.
- For production, consider minifying CSS/JS and adding performance optimizations.
